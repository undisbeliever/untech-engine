A complete character set of a female warrior I created for past games. All
assets I created for these projects are now published for free commercial and
uncommercial use.

There is also a repository of the game it was used in:
https://github.com/skoam/fumiko-pygame - Feel free to make a clone and continue
the game like you want! Don't expect too much from the coding style, I used to
learn python programming at the time I developed this and made many mistakes
regarding structure and convention. But it still works!
