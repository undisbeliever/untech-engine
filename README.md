UnTech Game Engine
==================

A homebrew game engine designed for a Super Nintendo Metroidvania game.


NOTICE
======

The untech-engine is still in the design/experimentation phase.  Expect
major and unexpected changes to the engine API.

I'm hoping to have the engine core completed in early 2019.  Once that
happens I'll aim to keep the engine API stable.
